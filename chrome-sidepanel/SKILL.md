## Overview

Chrome SidePanel API (Manifest V3) allows showing a side panel when users click the extension icon. This skill covers two use cases: (1) Opening a local sidepanel with per-tab configuration using `setOptions()` and `open()`, and (2) Opening remote URLs in the sidepanel using a two-step redirect process (Chrome 140+).
